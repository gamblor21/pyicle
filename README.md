# pyicle

Quick port of the Arduino code from https://learn.adafruit.com/holiday-icicle-lights-with-flair

Modified to run on the adafruit_neopxl8 library for faster RP2040 animations. Also takes advantage of the latest adafruit_pixelmap library that now uses core processing to speed up mapping of neopixels.

Icicles now grow and break over time.
